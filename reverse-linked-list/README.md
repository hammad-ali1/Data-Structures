# Reverse-linked-list
 This example code is taken from github repo:
    https://github.com/wadefagen/coursera.git in subdirectory "Linked-memory".

    Initial commit contains the original code. Further commits aim to modify
    the code so that linked list can be reversed using a member funcion call
    of class list.
